# Rabin Cryptosystem

<p> Rabin Cryptosystem is a public-key cryptosystem invented by Michael Rabin. It uses
asymmetric key encryption for communicating between two parties and encrypting the
message. The security of Rabin cryptosystem is related to the difficulty of factorization. It has
the advantage over the others that the problem on which it banks has proved to be hard
as integer factorization. It has the disadvantage also, that each output of the Rabin function
can be generated by any of four possible inputs. if each output is a ciphertext, extra
complexity is required on decryption to identify which of the four possible inputs was the
true plaintext.
